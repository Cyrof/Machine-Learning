# Machine learning Module (University)

Welcome to the repository for my machine learning topics covered in my university module! This repository is organised to store files for each topic studied during the course. Each folder represents a specific machine learning topic, containing relevant files such as code examples, datasets, and additional resources.

## Setting Up

To ensure a smooth setup and execution of the code examples, follow these steps:

1. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment:**

    Before proceeding, it's recommended to set up a Python virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies. Run the following commands to create a virtual environment named `ml-mod` and activate it:

    ```bash 
    $ python -m venv ml-mod
    $ source ml-mod/bin/activate
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required packages using pip:

    ```bash
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Note: It's essential to keep the virtual environment activated while working on this project. Additionally, any updates to the `requirements.txt` file should be manually installed by the user to update the virtual environment.

## Notes

Feel free to navigate through the folders to explore different machine learning topics and access related materials. Whether you're reviewing concepts or seeking additional resources, I hope you find this repository helpful in your learning journey.
